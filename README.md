Tile Breaker Game for iOS

## Overview of Game

Tile Breaker is an iOS game for the iPhone. When playing, there will be a pattern to the right of the screen. The goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible without having the tiles touch the bottom of the screen. The way to destroy tiles is by creating the pattern shown to the right of the screen. To switch tiles, the player only needs to tap one tile then the other. 

### Power-up Tiles:
There are four different power-up tiles that can occur within each game. 
The 💣 (bomb tile) eliminates the tiles two above and two below the bomb. 
The 💥 (target tile) eliminates all tiles of the chosen color. 
The 🗡 (knife tile) eliminates the chosen tile. 
The ⏸ (pause tile) pauses all tiles from falling for five seconds.
